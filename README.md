// Exercise
    Tip Calculator

 // Brief Description of what you did.
  I built a Tip Calculator using React and Tailwind CSS, it is responsive for both desktop and mobile screens. The app lets users input their bill amount, select a tip percentage, and see the total per person.

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Chris Wells-Hott, Your Code works good with calculation. Just some thing you missed where the mobile responsiveness like the design and the Cant be zero notification. Other than that good work
